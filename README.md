# Software Versioning Plugin

![Coverage Status][02] &nbsp; ![Latest version][01]

[Gradle Plugin][3] that versions automatically a project by a repository git tag.
It works across any platform and any environment that uses **Gradle** as its build automation system and **Git**
as its distributed version control system.

It is based on the [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0][1] recommendation and has been initially developed
to adopt the suggested [Google Play publishing scheme][2].


## Why choosing this library?

Because it keeps the process simple.

The problem with the various versioning plugins out there is that they are very complex to configure
due to the many options they provide and the time it takes to read all the documentation.

Regardless of the branching strategy you follow (Feature branch, Gitflow, Github, Trunk based, ...), 
this plugin will generate the version based on the amount of **commits** with a _major_, _minor_ or 
_patch_ keyword message on them.

That's it.


## How to apply?

    plugins {
        
        id 'com.chattylabs.versioning' version '<latest version>'
    }
 
-or-
 
    buildscript {
        
        repositories { 
        
            jcenter() 
            
            // Optional. Access to early versions.
            maven { url "https://dl.bintray.com/chattylabs/maven" }
        }
        
        dependencies {
        
            classpath 'com.chattylabs:versioning:<latest version>'
        }
    }
        
    apply plugin: 'com.chattylabs.versioning'
      
      
Setup the required and optional values in your gradle file.
 
    versioning {
        
        tagPrefix "version/"            // Optional. Default is empty.
        
        keywords {
        
            major "[incompatible]"      // Optional. By default it never upgrades the major version.
            minor "[feature]"           // Required
            patch "[bug]", "[patch]"    // Required
        }
    }

The plugin will generate a `version.properties` file within the project's module.
<br/>You should add this file into your `.gitignore` config.
    
    
## How to use?

The following functions are available:

    versioning.name()   // i.e. generates "0.1.0"  - string
    versioning.code()   // i.e. generates 000100   - integer

To update the version run:

    ./gradlew updateVersion
    
To increase the version run:

    git commit -m "ISSUE-99 [bug] ..."
    
    git push [..]
    
To persist the new version tag run:

    ./gradlew releaseVersion
    

## Where to use?

The followings are some platform examples:

**Web**

    version = versioning.name()

**Android**
     
    android {
        
        defaultConfig {
        
            [..]
            
            versionCode versioning.code()
            versionName versioning.name()
        }
    }
    
**iOS**
 
    afterEvaluate {
        
        // Use some (JVM) plist library such as Apache's common configuration http://commons.apache
        .org/proper/commons-configuration/ to update info.plist
        
        infoPlist.set(CFBundleShortVersionString, versioning.name())
        infoPlist.set(CFBundleVersion, "${versioning.code()}")
    }


## Important Notes


**Setup**

You must **create an initial version tag in your repository** following the `tagPrefix` and 
the `current version` of the project. Otherwise the build will throw an Exception.
    
```bash
git tag <tagPrefix + current version>   // i.e. "version/0.1.0" or "v0.1.0"
 
git push origin <tagPrefix + current version>
```


**Increasing versions**

The only rule to increase the version is that you add the keywords you have configured into the commit message.

```bash
git commit -m "ISSUE-99 [bug] ..." // This will increase the patch version - "0.1.1"
 
git commit -m "ISSUE-100 [feature] ..." // This will increase the minor version - "0.2.0"
 
[..]
```


**Continuous Integration**

If you are running the update through a **Continuous Integration** system, and you want to get 
the generated version, you can use the following bash function.

    function retrieveVersion() {
      if [ -f "$file" ]
      then
        printf "\"$file\" found."
        while IFS='=' read -r key value
        do
          eval ${key}=\${value}
        done < "$file" &> /dev/null
      else
        printf "\"$file\" not found."
      fi
    }
     
    file="./app/version.properties"
     
    # Example of use
     
    ./gradlew :app:updateVersion :app:assemble
     
    retrieveVersion
     
    versionName="${major#0}.${minor#0}.${patch#0}"
     
    # Publish to Google Play Store / Apple Store / Bintray / Fastlane / HockeyApp ...
     
    # Needs repository write access
    ./gradlew :app:releaseVersion 
     
    printf "New version <${versionName}> published successfuly"


**Multiple modules**

If you have several projects/modules into the same repository, and you want to generate a different 
version per project/module, you only need to establish a specific `tagPrefix` per module/version.
<br/>You also have to distinguish the projects/modules commits by a unique **keyword**.

    versioning {
            
        tagPrefix "${project.name}-version/"      // Use a unique prefix per each module
            
        keywords {
        
            ...
            
            minor "[${project.name}-feature]"     // Use a unique keyword for the commits
        }
    }
    
**Extras**

You can setup a different `.git` folder by applying the following option:

    versioning {

        git { // Optional. You can specify a custom .git folder path
        
            dir new File("../another/different/.git/folder")
        }
    }
